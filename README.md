# Cryptocurrency Data Analysis Project

This project is a web application that provides real-time and historical data analysis for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. It uses Flask for the web interface, SQLAlchemy for database management, and Plotly for visualizing data.

**Note:** This project is hosted on the free tier of Render, which may result in slower page load times. Additionally, crypto data cannot be updated via Cron Job, so it is manually updated peridocally. Thank you for your patience!
